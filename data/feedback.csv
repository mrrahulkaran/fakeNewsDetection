Woakes ruled out of remainder of Oval Test,"Chris Woakes has been ruled out of the remainder of the fifth Test against India at the Oval after sustaining an injury on his left shoulder on the opening day of the match.

""At this stage, the injury has ruled him out of any further participation in the Test,"" the England and Wales Cricket Board said in a statement on Friday ahead of the second day's play.

Woakes suffered the injury while fielding in the 57th over of India's first innings. He chased after the ball from mid-off and put in a dive to pull the ball back just inside the ropes. But he landed awkwardly and was seen holding his left shoulder in distress right away.",REAL
